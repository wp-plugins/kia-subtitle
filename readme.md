The KIA Subtitle plugin allows you to easily add a subtitle to your posts.

##Description

This plugin is adapted from Luc Princen's The Subtitle plugin http://www.to-wonder.com/the-subtitle.  It differs in its class-based organization, uses less jquery, and only saves the post meta when needed.

The subtitle allows you to easily add a subtitle to your posts and retrieve it in the loop in the same manner as the post title. By using the_subtitle() or get_the_subtitle().

It adds a simple inputfield right under the title field of posts, pages and any custom post type.  It also add a subtitle column to the edit screen as well as to the quick edit.

You can also use the shortcode [the-subtitle] to display it within the post content.

##Installation

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the 'the_subtitle()' tag to your theme:
		`if(function_exists('the_subtitle')) the_subtitle();`
1. if you need to 'return' the value, you can use `get_the_subtitle()` which accepts a `$post_id` parameter if you need to use it outside the loop
		`if(function_exists('the_subtitle')) $subtitle = get_the_subtitle( $post_id );`
1. As of version 1.2 `the_subtitle` accepts 3 parameters: `the_subtitle( $before = Null, $after = Null, $echo = True );`
1. As of version 1.3.4, there is a filter for `the_subtitle`

##Frequently Asked Questions

###How do I display the subtitle in my theme?

The simplest way is with the `the_subtitle()` template tag as follows:

```
if( function_exists( 'the_subtitle' ) ) the_subtitle();
```

You can wrap the string in some markup using the *$before* and *$after* parameters.

```
if( function_exists( 'the_subtitle' ) ) the_subtitle( '<h2 class="subtitle">', '</h2>' );
```

###Where do I add this code?

Unfortunately, I cannot tell you *exactly* what file to place the above code in because 1. I don't know where you want to display the subtitle and 2. every theme's structure is different.

However, in general, `the_subtitle()` is a template tag so you will want to put it in a template file.  Probably, you are looking for the file that contains your post loop.  For most themes it's *single.php* ( or *page.php* for pages ), but for many it could also be *content.php*.  Assuming you want the subtitle to display directly after your main title, you'd place the above code after:

```
<h1 class="entry-title"><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
```

As an *example* if you wanted to display the subtitle on standard single posts, in the Twenty Twelve theme you'd edit the content.php ( or preferabbly override the template in a child theme ):

```
<header class="entry-header">
	<?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>
	<?php if ( is_single() ) : ?>
	<h1 class="entry-title"><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
        <?php if( function_exists( 'the_subtitle' ) ) the_subtitle( '<h2 class="subtitle">', '</h2>' ); ?>
	<?php else : ?>
	<h1 class="entry-title">
		<a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php echo esc_attr( sprintf( __( 'Permalink to %s', 'twentytwelve' ), the_title_attribute( 'echo=0' ) ) ); ?>" rel="bookmark"><?php the_title(); ?></a>
	</h1>
	<?php endif; // is_single() ?>
	<?php if ( comments_open() ) : ?>
		<div class="comments-link">
			<?php comments_popup_link( '<span class="leave-reply">' . __( 'Leave a reply', 'twentytwelve' ) . '</span>', __( '1 Reply', 'twentytwelve' ), __( '% Replies', 'twentytwelve' ) ); ?>
		</div><!-- .comments-link -->
	<?php endif; // comments_open() ?>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
```

###How do I style the subtitle?

If you have wrapped the subtitle in an H2 tag with the class of subtitle like in the second example above, you can then style it any way you'd like.

```
h2.subtitle { color: pink; }
```
